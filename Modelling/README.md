I've grabbed the dates from auravision and selected the data for each country when they were in lockdown this is in `modelData`. 

You need the files population_aged_20_39, population_aged_40_59 and average_temperature to run the code.


BREAKING THE COUNTRIES INTO GROUPS BASED ON LOCKDOWN LENGTH

Based on the histogram of lockdown length the majority of countries fall between 50 and 75 days. and there are only 11 countries on each side outside of this range. 
The code for the histogram is commented out in the r file.

I made a template for these countries and checked the model just to see but a function to select specific countries based on lockdown length would be more reproducible 

effects analysis.rmd has the modelling of GCMR data
