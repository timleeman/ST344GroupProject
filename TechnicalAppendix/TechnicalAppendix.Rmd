The data for each country has been divided into their pre, intra and post lockdown dates. This used the functions `pre_lockdown_start date`, `lockdown_end_date` and `get_lockdown_data` and then each individual country's data was binded together. This was done using the Auravision data and then a rolling mean was calculated 
using the 3days before and after a specific day. This method means that although we were looking at data from a week before, the mean could only be calculated from four days before the start of lockdown and stopped three days before the end.
